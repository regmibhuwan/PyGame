# Pygame Moving Image Application
## Description
This project is a simple demonstration of using Pygame, a popular library for writing video games in Python. The application creates a graphical window where an image of a robot moves continuously from left to right and then right to left across the screen. This project serves as an introductory exercise into game development concepts such as event handling, animation, and using graphical user interfaces.

## Features
- Dynamic Image Movement: Utilizes basic animation principles to move an image horizontally across the window.
- Event Handling: Implements Pygame's event handling to manage user interactions like closing the window.
- Frame Rate Control: Ensures smooth animation by controlling the frame rate to a steady 60 frames per second.
## Technologies Used
- Python: The core programming language used.
- Pygame: A Python library designed for writing video games. It includes modules for graphics, sound, and input handling.
## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure Python is Installed:
- This application requires Python to be installed on your computer. You can download Python from python.org.
2. Install Pygame:
- Pygame can be installed via pip. Open your command line or terminal and run:

  pip install pygame
3. Download the Project Files:
Download the source code from the repository and extract it to a local directory.
4. Add an Image:
Place an image named robot.png in the same directory as the script. This image will be the one moving across the screen.
## Running the Application
- Navigate to the directory containing the project files in your command line or terminal.
- Run the script with Python by typing:

python main.py
- The application window will open displaying the moving image. You can close the window to exit the application.
